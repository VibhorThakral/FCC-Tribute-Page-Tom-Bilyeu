                Tom Bilyeu is a filmmaker and serial entrepreneur who chased money HARD for nearly a decade and came up emotionally bankrupt. He realized that the struggle is guaranteed, but the money is not, so you’d damn-well better love the struggle.
            </p>
            <p> 
                To that end, he and his partners sold their technology company and founded Quest Nutrition – a company predicated not on money, but rather on creating value for people. 

            </p>
            <p>
                The company mission was to end metabolic disease – one of two pandemics facing the planet. Despite not being focused on money Quest exploded, becoming a billion dollar business in roughly 5 years, making it the 2nd fastest growing company in North America according to Inc. Magazine. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After exiting Quest and generating extraordinary personal wealth, Bilyeu turned his attention to the other pandemic facing society – the poverty of poor mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve the mindset problem at scale and help hundreds of millions of people adopt an empowering mindset he has co-founded the media studio, Impact Theory with his business partner and wife, Lisa Bilyeu.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their aim is to influence the cultural subconscious by building a single-minded content creation machine that makes exactly one type of content – content that empowers people. If Disney created the most magical place on earth, Impact Theory will be creating the most empowering place on earth.
